Within these fruitful collaborations, she participated in more than 20 national and international projects.
From 2015/09 to 2024/04, she was the PI of a bilateral project between INESC-ID and Unbabel, a translation company combining AI + post-editing, working on scalable Linguistic Quality Assurance processes for crowdsourcing. She was responsible for the implementation in 2015 of the MQM metric, the creation of the Linguistic Quality Assurance processes developed at Unbabel for Linguistic Annotation and Editors' Evaluation. She also worked on research projects, involving Linguistics, Translation, and Responsible AI, and products developed by the Labs Team, mostly cultural transcreation, high risk products, and silently controlled language metrics for dialogues.
In a sentence, she is passionate about Language Technologies in a human-centric perspective and always feels like a child eager to learn!
