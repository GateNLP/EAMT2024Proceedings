In this tutorial, we focus on a niche area of neural machine translation (NMT) that aims to incorporate linguistics into different stages in the NMT pipeline, from pre-processing to model training to evaluation. We first introduce the background of NMT and fundamental analysis tools, such as word segmenters, part-of-speech taggers, and dependency parsers. We then cover topics including 1) word/subword segmentation, and character decomposition during MT data pre-processing, 2) incorporating direct and indirect linguistic features into NMT models, and 3) fine-grained linguistic evaluation for MT systems. We reveal the impact of orthography, syntax, and semantics information on translation performance. This tutorial is mainly aimed at researchers interested in the intersection of linguistics and low-resource machine translation. We hope this tutorial inspires and encourages them to develop linguistically motivated high-quality MT systems and evaluation benchmarks.
